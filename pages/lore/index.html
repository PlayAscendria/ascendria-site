            <p class="narrator"><em>Narrated by: Janos, the Royal Cartographer</em></p>

            <h2>The Beginning of Silence</h2>
            
            <p>"Many say that our end began with fire. They are wrong. The end began with silence. I remember when the wind stopped blowing in Aurelia. I remember watching fields of wheat turn to dust between the fingers of farmers, and the prayers of clerics echoing against the ceilings of empty temples. The world was not dying screaming; it was dying slowly, like breathing during sleep.</p>
            
            <p>It was King Aethernus who refused to accept that this was normal. I remember the night he entered my library, not as a sovereign, but as a man yearning for answers. — <em>'What is killing my people, Janos?'</em> — he asked. Together, we descended to the foundations I myself feared to visit. And there, under the dust of ages, we searched for answers among the oldest scrolls and tattered books, until we found our fate revealed in one of the chapters of a tome: <strong>The Book of Centuries.</strong>"</p>

            <h2>The Discovery of the Curse</h2>
            
            <p>"My hands trembled as I turned those pages of white metal. What we read there was not legend or simple history; every word of that tome echoed within us. The chapter was titled <em>'The Betrayal of Nihil'</em>. It told of the Primordial Dragon and his act of treason against the Nameless God. All for the sake of knowledge and power. Nihil wanted to be omniscient so he could be worshipped as the Creator. But Nihil's plan was intercepted. The omniscience of the Nameless God cursed him:</p>
            
            <blockquote>'Your hunger for knowledge and power shall be sated, but you shall never reign over life; your slumber will slowly destroy everything around you, and you shall reign only over ashes.'</blockquote>
            
            <p>The King closed the book immediately, with a slam that still echoes in my mind. He understood before I did. That was not a drought. It was the breathing of an envious and accursed monster."</p>

            <h2>The Shadow in the South</h2>
            
            <p>"We still held hope that we were mistaken, that the book contained only tales. The King then sent Orion, our Head Scout, to hunt these ghosts—I confess I prayed that nothing would be found. Months passed. The silence in the castle was deafening.</p>
            
            <p>When Orion returned, I barely recognized him. The man who laughed at death was pale, broken. — <em>'He is there, my King'</em> — Orion whispered, and I saw real fear for the first time. — <em>'At the peak of Mount Peirasmós. He is resting.'</em> At that moment, I knew that a war of swords would be useless. You do not fight the Void with steel. I did not know what to do, but our King seemed to have understood everything."</p>

            <h2>The Preparation and the Fast</h2>
            
            <p>"The King bore a distant look, reflecting on the abyss that had been discovered. Then, determination took hold of his eyes. He called Barnabé and ordered: — <em>'Barnabé, my friend, I need you to host an event with music, festivity, and food. Lots of food!'</em></p>
            
            <p>Barnabé, confused, retorted: — <em>'My King, we are in difficult times, we must ration!'</em> But the King held his friend's shoulder and said: — <em>'Just trust me. Do what I ask. While you feast with the people to give them hope, I will seek the way out of our situation.'</em></p>
            
            <p>The King then took his sword and headed towards isolation. He entered the dense Senkoura Forest, a dark, empty, but safe place. There, he stayed for seven days. He faced hunger and silence to quiet his mind, in search of truths that no weapon could give him. And on the last day, he remembered the reason for Nihil's curse: the inability to Reign. <em>'If I propose the wisdom of a King to him,'</em> thought Aethernus, <em>'perhaps I can bargain for something that saves us.'"</em></p>

            <h2>The Wisdom of Farewell</h2>
            
            <p>"Upon returning from his exile in the forest, the King did something that will make me follow him to the ends of the earth. He gathered our council. He knew he was going to surrender himself to the beast. He knew Aurelia would fall. But he did not weep. He commanded with the prudence of a father caring for his children:</p>
            
            <ul class="royal-orders">
              <li><strong>To Orion:</strong> 'Take the people to the Senkoura Forest. I have been there; the trees will hide our tracks.'</li>
              <li><strong>To Barnabé:</strong> 'My friend, continue to smile in the square, but fill the wagons in the back. Give them joy today so they have strength tomorrow.'</li>
              <li><strong>To Mnemon:</strong> 'Take your hammer and anvil. Where your anvil is, there shall be our home.'</li>
              <li><strong>To Aurion:</strong> 'Take only the coins. Gold, silver, and bronze. We will certainly need them.'</li>
              <li><strong>To Silas:</strong> 'Keep yourself safe. Your words and enchantments are too valuable to be lost.'</li>
              <li><strong>To Soren:</strong> 'Collect everything useful for the maintenance of life, every herb and every vial.'</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And to me, he said:</p>
            
            <blockquote>'Janos, guard the history, the maps, and our memories. If we forget who we are, Nihil will erase us.'</blockquote>
            
            <p>With that said, he departed towards Mount Peirasmós, not knowing what awaited him: death or glory."</p>

            <h2>The Ascent to the Abyss</h2>
            
            <p>The journey to the top of Mount Peirasmós lasted a day but felt like an era. With every step, the air became thinner and heavier, impregnated with the smell of sulfur and ozone. The mountain itself seemed to reject human presence, with sharp rocks and winds that whispered hopelessness.</p>
            
            <p>When Aethernus reached the plateau, he did not find just a monster. He found darkness incarnate. Nihil awaited him. The Primordial Dragon was vast like a petrified storm, his scales absorbing the sunlight, creating an eternal shadow around him.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "Well... a king," Nihil's voice vibrated in Aethernus's bones, cynical and ancient. — "To what do I owe the honor of such a distinguished visit to my slaughterhouse?"</p>
            
            <p>The King stood alone, small before the beast, but his spine was erect. He did not draw his sword. He bowed his head. — <em>"The honor is mine, Nihil, the Devourer."</em> The dragon's colossal chest puffed out, vanity being his first exposed weakness. — <em>"I see my fame has reached you."</em> — <em>"It has,"</em> replied the King, walking closer to the abyss. — <em>"But along with it came a doubt that disturbs me: How does a being so powerful live hidden like a fugitive, instead of ruling and being loved?"</em></p>

            <h2>The Bait of Vanity</h2>
            
            <p>The question struck Nihil like a whip. The fire in his eyes changed from hunger to hatred. He growled, and the earth trembled.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "You dare mock my condition?"</p>
            
            <p>— <em>"It is not mockery,"</em> said Aethernus, with the calm of one walking to the guillotine. — <em>"It is a proposal. I have the answer to your torment. I can teach you to reign. But, in exchange... I demand the Knowledge you stole from the heavens."</em></p>
            
            <p>Nihil let out a laugh that cracked nearby stones.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "A mortal wanting to bargain with the Infinite? What do you have that I do not?"</p>
            
            <p>— <em>"Wisdom,"</em> said the King. — <em>"Knowledge gave you power, dragon. But the lack of wisdom gave you loneliness. I can teach you to be a King, and not just a plague."</em></p>
            
            <p>The word "King" intoxicated the dragon. The curse of the Nameless God burned in him; he desperately wanted to be worshipped.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "Very well," hissed Nihil. — "Choose what you wish to know, and I will tear your mind apart with the truth."</p>
            
            <p>Aethernus looked up, knowing that this would be the end of his life as a common man. — <em>"Teach me everything about the sources of power in this land. The ancient cities. The forgotten machines. Everything."</em></p>

            <h2>The Birth of the Mark</h2>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "Done." — thundered the dragon.</p>
            
            <p>An orb of violet and black light formed between Nihil's claws. It was not just light; it was solid information, heavy as lead, spinning with the violence of a contained hurricane. With a cruel gesture, Nihil fired the sphere directly against the King's face. Aethernus, in a purely human reflex, in an act of desperate defense, raised his right hand to protect his eyes.</p>

            <h2>The Collapse</h2>
            
            <p>The sphere collided against the King's open palm. There was no explosion, no push. There was <em>penetration</em>. The energy of knowledge traversed the flesh like an incandescent nail of cosmic size being hammered through his hand. The violet light pierced the skin, cauterized the tendons, fused to the bones, and shot violently up the nerves of the arm straight to the brain.</p>
            
            <p>The pain was absolute. It was beyond what human biology could process. Aethernus opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. His eyes rolled back, showing only the whites. His nervous system went into total collapse to protect his mind from madness. The world went black instantly. The King's body fell heavy on the stone floor, inert, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.</p>

            <h2>The Awakening (Five Days Later)</h2>
            
            <p>When Aethernus finally pulled air into his lungs again, he tasted blood and dust. He did not know how much time had passed. His head felt heavy, full of echoes of ancient voices and images of machines he had never seen. He tried to get up, leaning on his right hand. An electric shock of agony shot up his arm, making him gasp.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at his hand. In the center of the palm, pulsating in a vivid and painful purple, was the <strong>Master Rune</strong>. Veins of violet light climbed up his wrist, disappearing under his dirty sleeve. The wound did not bleed blood; it leaked light. He was marked.</p>
            
            <p>Above him, Nihil's laughter sounded like thunder, amused by the fragility of that being.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "Awake, little King?" — mocked the dragon. — "You drooled in the dust for five days. I thought your mind had turned to mush."</p>
            
            <p>Aethernus, still dizzy and with vision blurred by pain, closed his marked fist, feeling the Rune burn. He stood up, trembling, but alive.</p>

            <h2>The Checkmate</h2>
            
            <p>Nihil watched the King's trembling body with sadistic amusement.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "Too much for you, insect? Ha-ha-ha! Now fulfill your part! Tell me: How do I govern with wisdom? How do I break my curse?"</p>
            
            <p>Aethernus stood tall. He was weak, but his eyes shone with a strength the dragon did not know. He wiped the blood from his mouth.</p>
            
            <p>— <em>"It is simple,"</em> whispered the King.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "SPEAK!" — roared the dragon.</p>
            
            <p>— <em>"To govern with wisdom..."</em> — Aethernus looked deep into the beast's eyes — <em>"...you need to put yourself in the place of the other. You need to serve those who are lesser than you."</em></p>
            
            <p>The dragon froze.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil">— "That... that makes no sense. How do I use wisdom not to destroy?"</p>
            
            <p>The King smiled, a sad and victorious smile. — <em>"You cannot. Wisdom is sacrifice. And you, Nihil, are incapable of loving anything other than yourself."</em></p>
            
            <p>The silence lasted a second, followed by Nihil's horrible realization: he had been deceived by the truth. He had given up his treasure and remained cursed, for his nature prevented him from serving.</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil roar">— "INSECT!" — The roar of hatred was so strong that Aethernus was thrown to the ground. — "YOU STOLE FROM ME! IF I CANNOT HAVE A KINGDOM, NEITHER SHALL YOU! WATCH THE FALL OF YOUR BELOVED AURELIA!"</p>
            
            <p>With a beat of wings that generated a hurricane, Nihil launched himself into the skies, a shadow of death descending upon the world.</p>

            <h2>The Descent of the Marked King</h2>
            
            <p>The King stood alone at the peak, the wind howling around him, kicking up the dust where his body had lain for five days.</p>
            
            <p>He brought his right hand close to his chest, holding his wrist with his left hand as if trying to contain a fire. The palm pulsed with a feverish violet glow. It hurt. It hurt in a deep, bone-crushing way. Every time his mind touched the vast knowledge acquired, the Rune in his hand reacted, sending shocks of agony through his arm.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at the dragon's shadow diminishing in the distance, heading towards his castle.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"Burn the stones, Nihil," — whispered Aethernus. A solitary tear ran down his face and fell onto his open palm, sizzling and evaporating upon touching the purple, hot light of the mark. — "You will burn the past. But the future... the future is now engraved in my hand."</blockquote>
            
            <p>He closed his fingers over the Rune, shielding the light, and began to descend the mountain. Every step was heavy. He was no longer just a man; he was the living map of salvation, descending to the world with the scar of his victory burning in the palm of his hand.</p>

            <h2>The Wounded Shepherd Returns</h2>
            
            <p>"The night of Aurelia's fall was illuminated by a black fire that emitted no heat, only cold. Hidden in the absolute darkness of the Senkoura Forest—a place so dense that not even a dragon's gaze could penetrate—we waited. When Aethernus finally emerged between the twisted trunks, silence fell over us. He walked staggering, supporting his right arm against his chest. Barnabé ran to him, weeping: — <em>'My King! We are all here. As you commanded.'</em></p>
            
            <p>The King tried to smile, but the pain prevented him. He moved his hand away from his chest and showed us the price of our salvation. It was not a cut. In the center of his right palm, pulsating in a feverish and terrifying violet, was the <strong>Master Rune</strong>. Veins of light climbed his wrist, connecting that ancient knowledge to his soul. — <em>'I have not failed you'</em> — he whispered, his voice hoarse. — <em>'I have the salvation, and I will guide everyone along the path.'"</em></p>

            <h2>The Shadow and the Promise</h2>
            
            <p>"Before we could tend to his wounds, the sky above the trees darkened even further. A titanic beating of wings made the forest tremble. Branches snapped. And Nihil's voice, distorted by hatred, fell like thunder upon us:</p>
            
            <p class="dialogue nihil roar">— "AETHERNUS! YOU CANNOT HIDE THEM FOREVER! I WILL HUNT EVERY ONE OF THESE INSECTS!"</p>
            
            <p>Fear almost paralyzed us, but the King raised his marked hand. The purple light shone in the darkness, and he ordered with absolute firmness: — <em>'Inside. Now.'</em> While we hid in the deep roots, he whispered to the council:</p>
            
            <blockquote>'Today, we lost our city. But tomorrow, we begin to build what not even a dragon can destroy. Today ends Aurelia. But begins <strong>ASCENDRIA</strong>.'</blockquote>

            <h2>The Path of Pain (The 30-Day Journey)</h2>
            
            <p>"The next morning, we left the forest. The world was divided: to the South, the ashes of our past; to the North, the Spine of the World, majestic and distant. We began the march. Thirty days of walking. And it was in those days that we understood who Aethernus really was.</p>
            
            <p>Whenever thirst struck and the canteens ran dry, I saw my King close his eyes and extend his right hand over the dry earth. I saw the Rune shine, pulsating with a pain that would make lesser men faint. He accessed the beast's mind to find groundwater. He groaned, cold sweat poured down, but water sprang forth. Whenever the cold of the night threatened the children, he used his wounded hand to teach Silas to weave enchantments of warmth. He suffered so that we could sleep. He bled light so that we could drink. He was our wounded shepherd, guiding the flock through the valley of the shadow."</p>

            <h2>The Arrival and the Touch</h2>
            
            <p>"And now, we are here. Before the inert wall of the Spine of the World. There are no doors. There are no gates. Only solid, cold rock.</p>
            
            <p>The people looked desolate, but the King walked to the mountain. He looked exhausted, every step a struggle. He raised his right hand—the hand marked by the nail of light—and pressed it against the raw rock.</p>
            
            <p>There was a deep sound, like that of an ancient machine awakening. The violet light of the Rune spread from the King's palm to the mountain, drawing lines, gears, and tunnels through the solid stone, revealing the spectral vision of the buried city.</p>
            
            <blockquote>'It is here...' — the King whispered, and his knees gave way. Orion caught him before he fell. With a last thread of voice, Aethernus pointed to a fissure illuminated by his own pain: — 'Dig here. Bring hope to the light.'</blockquote>

            <h2>The First Strike</h2>
            
            <p>"I look at the pickaxe in my hand. I look at the people around me—Barnabé, Mnemon, the Alchemist, all ready. We are no longer citizens of Aurelia. We are the <strong>Children of the Promise</strong>. We do not dig for gold. We dig because He suffered for us.</p>
            
            <p class="final-line">I raise my arm. The steel cuts the air. <strong>The Great Excavation begins now.</strong>"</p>
