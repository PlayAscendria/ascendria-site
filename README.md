# Ascendria — Static Clone Demo

This is a small static scaffold inspired by the layout and topbar style of Axie Infinity (for educational/demo purposes).

Files created:
- `index.html` — homepage scaffold
- `css/style.css` — styles including fixed topbar
- `components/header.html` — header component (for manual reuse)
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple placeholder logo

How to run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location 'd:\PROJETOS\ASCENDRIA\ascendria-site'
py -m http.server 8000
# or
python -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser:
http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps you can ask me to do:
- Replace placeholder assets with your real images (logo, backgrounds, icons).
- Add dropdowns, mobile menu content, and animations.
- Match fonts/colors more closely to a reference design.

License & notes:
- This scaffold is an original implementation for learning and prototyping. Do not copy proprietary assets or exact content from third-party sites without permission.
